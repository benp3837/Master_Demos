<p style="border-bottom:2px solid black;">Hello Angular! I'm a statically rendered paragraph element. I'll never leave the page.</p>

<!-- Statically rendering the parent component. Remember to add this to the IMPORTS ARRAY in app.component.ts -->
<app-parent-component/>

<!-- This allows us to use routing, which is super important but we'll see it in the next demo -->
<router-outlet />
